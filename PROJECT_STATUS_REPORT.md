# Project Status Report: Cafeteria POS Redesign

**Date:** 2025-09-05

**Author:** Jules

## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to perform a full redesign and production hardening of the Cafeteria POS application. Work was initiated to stabilize the build and implement a new UI for the Items and Reports screens, followed by a broader set of UI enhancements.

However, the project is currently in a **critical and unstable state**. The codebase is plagued by deep-seated inconsistencies, a fragile build process, and a series of cascading compilation errors that have made it impossible to complete and verify the requested features.

This document outlines the current issues, the work that has been attempted, and a recommended path forward for recovery.

## 2. Current Critical Issues

### 2.1. Build & Environment Instability

The primary blocker is the inability to reliably compile, test, and run the application.

-   **Silent `mvn javafx:run` Failures:** The standard command to run the application fails silently, exiting immediately without providing any error messages or logs. This makes UI verification impossible.
-   **`mvn package` File Limit Errors:** Attempts to package the application into a runnable JAR fail due to an environmental limitation on the number of files that can be generated in the `target/` directory.
-   **Inconsistent Build State:** The build process appears to be non-deterministic. At times, files seem to be reverted to a previous state, causing fixed compilation errors to reappear. This suggests a potential issue with the development environment's state management.

### 2.2. Codebase Inconsistencies

The root cause of the build failures is a highly inconsistent and fragile codebase.

-   **Schema vs. Code Mismatch:** There are numerous discrepancies between the database schema defined in `V1__Initial.sql` and the SQL queries and model interactions in the DAO layer. A major example is the inconsistent use of `user_id` vs. `cashier_id` and `recorded_by`.
-   **Inconsistent Object-Oriented Practices:** The codebase is a mix of different coding styles. Some models use public fields, while others use private fields with getters and setters. This has led to a cascade of compilation errors as refactoring one part of the code breaks another.
-   **Missing Files:** The initial state of the repository was missing critical files, including several FXML views (`ItemsView.fxml`, `ReportsView.fxml`, etc.) and model classes (`Shift.java`, `Role.java`, `DateRangeReport.java`), which had to be recreated from scratch.
-   **Inconsistent File Paths:** FXML files were being loaded from multiple, inconsistent locations (`/fxml/` vs. `/ui/`), leading to `NullPointerExceptions` at runtime.

### 2.3. Incomplete and Unverified Features

Due to the issues above, none of the newly implemented features can be considered complete or functional.

-   **UI Screens:** The new Dashboard, Items, Users, and Reports screens have been implemented in code, but they have never been visually verified. It is highly likely they contain visual bugs and layout issues.
-   **Core Functionality Regressions:** In the process of refactoring the UI, critical logic for session management and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) was removed from the main application controller and not fully reimplemented.

## 3. Work Left to Do: A Recovery Plan

The project requires a systematic, layer-by-layer stabilization effort before any new feature work can continue.

1.  **Stabilize the Build (Priority 0):**
    *   **Resolve Environment Issues:** The silent failures of `mvn javafx:run` must be diagnosed. This may require running the application with more verbose logging or using a different execution method.
    *   **Fix `.gitignore`:** The `target/` directory must be added to a `.gitignore` file to resolve the packaging errors.

2.  **Stabilize the Data Layer:**
    *   **Finalize Schema:** Lock down the `V1__Initial.sql` file as the single source of truth.
    *   **Refactor All Models:** Ensure every model class (`User`, `Order`, `Item`, etc.) uses private fields and getters/setters consistently.
    *   **Refactor All DAOs:** Update every DAO to match the schema and the refactored models.

3.  **Stabilize the Service & UI Layers:**
    *   **Refactor Services:** Update all service classes to align with the new DAOs and models.
    *   **Fix Controllers:** Update all UI controllers to use the correct service methods and models.
    *   **Fix FXML Paths:** Ensure all FXML files are loaded from a single, consistent location.

4.  **Implement and Verify Features (Incrementally):**
    *   Once the application is stable and runnable, re-implement the requested features **one by one**, with full testing and verification at each step:
        1.  Dashboard
        2.  User Management
        3.  Settings & Theming
        4.  UI/UX Enhancements & Accessibility
        5.  Final UI Polish

5.  **Add New Tests:**
    *   The current test suite is sparse. New unit and integration tests must be written for all the new functionality to prevent future regressions.

## 4. Conclusion

The project is recoverable, but it requires a disciplined and systematic approach. The immediate focus must be on stabilizing the build and refactoring the existing code into a consistent and reliable state. Only then can the exciting new features be implemented successfully.
