RULES FOR ALL AGENTS (must be included in every prompt)

Do not recreate or change DAO public signatures in src/main/java/.../dao/.

Tests-first: If unsure what to change, create a failing test that reproduces the issue and show failing test output before fixing it.

Keep commits small and atomic. Include unit tests for every logic change.

Use branch names feature/<short> and open PRs to main.

Provide a short PR description, list of tests added, and a one-line risk summary.
